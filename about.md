Hey, it's Guezota, another maique alter ego.  

As I try to build an app, just to learn how to do it, I wanted a place to document the process. I created a [Tumblr](http://guezota.tumblr.com) for that, since I already know my around around over there, but felt it would be more fitting to have it hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) managed.  

Still a lot to do, the theme still has some of the original settings, but it's moving along.  

So, [here](http://guezota.github.io/) it is, the migrated version. Enjoy.
