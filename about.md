Hey, it's Guezota, another [maique](http://twitter.com/maique) alter ego. The geekier one.  

As I try to build an app, just to learn how to do it, I wanted a place to document the process. I created a [Tumblr](http://guezota.tumblr.com) for that, since I already know my around around over there, but felt it would be more fitting to have it hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) managed.  

Still a lot to do, the theme still has some of the original settings, but it's moving along. [Here](http://guezota.github.io/) it is, the migrated version.  

As the app will probably take forever, as things usually do around these parts, it's probable that some other stuff will also show up here, as long as it's loosely connected to web or code projects. The geekier stuff.  

Enjoy.  

You can find the real me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maique) and [GitHub](https://github.com/maique).
