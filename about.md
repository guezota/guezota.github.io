Hey, it's Guezota, another [maique](http://twitter.com/maique) alter ego.  

As I try to build an app, just to learn how to do it, I wanted a place to document the process. I created a [Tumblr](http://guezota.tumblr.com) for that, since I already know my around around over there, but felt it would be more fitting to have it hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) managed.  

Still a lot to do, the theme still has some of the original settings, but it's moving along. [Here](http://guezota.github.io/) it is, the migrated version.  

Enjoy.  

You can find the real me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maique) and [GitHub](https://github.com/maique).
